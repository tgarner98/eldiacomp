        <img class="mx-auto d-block map" src="css/media/anura.jpg" alt="">
          <p class="text">Anura, homeland of the Humans, is the largest of all ten provinces, made up of rolling green plains, dense forests, and tall mountains. The province directly 
          neighbors Geirsa to the North and Zurdol to the East. The use of magic in Anura is considered taboo, with the majority of the population 
          believing magic to be dark and twisted of nature. The major races that inhabit Anura are Humans, Wood Elves, and Dwarves.
          </p>
        <!--Anura Cities-->
        <h1 class="h1-chapter">Cities</h1>
        <hr>
          <p class="text">Anura has six major cities, not including the ruined city of Ebonthorn. The majority of smaller villages are spread across the Anuran Plains, 
          supplying the kingdom with food and crops.

          city is the most racially diversified in Anura, with people of all backgrounds visiting Vyria for work, trade, and travel. The Royal Gardens District, 
          home to Castle Vyria and the neighboring manors, are patrolled by the Royal Guard, the King's elite group of highly trained soldiers. Vyria's major export is fish, and their 
          major import is food and crops.
          </p>
          <!--Kheka-->
          <h2 class="h2-chapter">Kheka</h2>
            <p class="text">Kheka is second to Vyria in terms of size and security, and is a heavily militarized city, being home to the majority of the 
              Anuran Army, as well as the army's training camp. Kheka's strategic location allows for quick and easy travel to Vyria directly to the west, the Doldiac Valley and Geirsa, and 
              Zurdol Canyon. Kheka's only major export is considered to be soldiers, and their major import is weapons and armor. The current count of Kheka is Count Lawrence Symons, a retired general 
              of the Anuran Army.

            <p class="text">Balwood is located within the Elemere forest, providing plenty opportunity for hunters and lumber workers. Unlike other Anuran 
              cities, the majority of Balwood citizens are Wood Elves that make use of their natural-born skills. Balwood's major export is meat, hides, and lumber, 
              and their major import is crops and metal. The current count of Balwood is Count Rhys Virro, a hunter skilled at tracking rare and exotic wildlife.

          <!--Stagvale-->
          <h2 class="h2-chapter">Stagvale</h2>
            <p class="text">Stagvale, originally Geirsan territory until given to Anura as a peace offering to end the Winter War, is isolated from the rest of Anura within the Doldiac Valley. 
              Unlike the rest of Anura, Stagvale not only welcomes the practice of magic, but encourages its use, going against common Anuran beliefs of magic's dark nature. Stagvale's location 
              within the Doldiac Valley is the envy of many within Anura, situated on a cliff providing a beautiful view of the entire valley. Stagvale's major export is lumber and herbs, and 
              their major import is food and crops. The current count of Stagvale is Countess Astrid Saunders, a famous author and scholar that studies Anuran flora and its applications in alchemy.
            </p>
          <!--Ebonthorn-->
          <h2 class="h2-chapter">Ebonthorn</h2>
            <p class="text">Once a bustling port town, Ebonthorn fell victim to the ongoing Zurdolan War, destroyed during the Battle of Ebonthorn. Only the brave or foolish tread through the 
              crumbled streets, with Ebonthorn believed by both Humans and Orcs to be haunted by the vengeful spirits of those that lost their lives during the battle. The last count to rule 
              Ebonthorn was Countess Anna Patel, who met her demise defending her people from the onslaught of the Zurdolan Horde.
            </p>
        <!--Anura Government-->
        <h1 class="h1-chapter">Anuran Government</h1>
        <hr>
          <p class="text">Each city is ruled by a Count and a Council of Representatives, consisting of nine representatives including the Count. The Council of Representatives vote on 
            decisions regarding their city, ranging from local crime, guard duties, allocation of tax money, and much more. The representatives are selected from the city's 
            population by the Count, who hold their position for a maximum of four years. The Count holds their position for as long as desired. The count is voted into power by 
            the Royal Council, seated in Vyria. The Royal Council consists of twelve nobles, two from each city, and the King of Anura, with the twelve nobles being hand-selected by 
            the King himself. The Royal Council votes on decisions regarding the kingdom as a whole, such as economy, taxes, military, and royal crime. The King of Anura is crowned 
            from the Sira royal family, who holds the throne for life, the end of which, a new heir is chosen.
          </p>
        <!--Anura Culture-->
        <h1 class="h1-chapter">Anuran Culture</h1>
        <hr>
          <p class="text">The majority of the Anuran people follow the teachings of Eldath, Goddess of Peace. As followers of Eldath, Anura was founded on the ideals of Peace, Order, and 
            Righteousness, heiled as the Three Pillars that Anurans devoutly follow. Anurans celebrate the Festival of Eldath, a holy and spiritual event held 
            in each city on the 1st of Kythorn, worshipping Eldath through food, music, and performances. The use of magic is considered by most in Anura to be dark and twisted of nature, 
            and is therefore shunned in nearly every major city, save for Stagvale, which sees magic as a gift instead of a curse. Many Anuran children grow up aspiring to be Knights of the
            Anuran Army, defenders of peace. Though few reach that level of prestige, many still become great warriors that band together into guilds to uphold the Three Pillars of Anura, as well as 
            provide sword and shield to those that cannot protect themselves.
