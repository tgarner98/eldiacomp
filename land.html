              Unlike the rest of Anura, Stagvale not only welcomes the practice of magic, but encourages its use, going against common Anuran beliefs of magic's dark nature. Stagvale's location 
              within the Doldiac Valley is the envy of many within Anura, situated on a cliff providing a beautiful view of the entire valley. Stagvale's major export is lumber and herbs, and

            decisions regarding their city, ranging from local crime, guard duties, allocation of tax money, and much more. The representatives are selected from the city's 
            population by the Count, who hold their position for a maximum of four years. The Count holds their position for as long as desired. The count is voted into power by 
            the Royal Council, seated in Vyria. The Royal Council consists of twelve nobles, two from each city, and the King of Anura, with the twelve nobles being hand-selected by 
            the King himself. The Royal Council votes on decisions regarding the kingdom as a whole, such as economy, taxes, military, and royal crime. The King of Anura is crowned 
            from the Sira royal family, who holds the throne for life, the end of which, a new heir is chosen.

        <h1 class="h1-chapter">Anuran Culture</h1>
          <p class="text">The majority of the Anuran people follow the teachings of Eldath, Goddess of Peace. As followers of Eldath, Anura was founded on the ideals of Peace, Order, and 
            Righteousness, heiled as the Three Pillars that Anurans devoutly follow. Anurans celebrate the Festival of Eldath, a holy and spiritual event held 
            in each city on the 1st of Kythorn, worshipping Eldath through food, music, and performances. The use of magic is considered by most in Anura to be dark and twisted of nature, 
            and is therefore shunned in nearly every major city, save for Stagvale, which sees magic as a gift instead of a curse. Many Anuran children grow up aspiring to be Knights of the
            Anuran Army, defenders of peace. Though few reach that level of prestige, many still become great warriors that band together into guilds to uphold the Three Pillars of Anura, as well as 
            provide sword and shield to those that cannot protect themselves.

              Amaun cargo ships, making the company one of the most feared pirate crews in the entire Crystal Sea.</p>

                  is Pharaoh Bhasashi that rules over all of the desert from Amaun. Outside the capital city, the pharaoh's guards are considered to be the rulers of each city, and 
                  enforce the law with an iron fist. Though the majority of the desert's inhabitants support the pharaoh's rule, those that speak ill against the pharaoh are persecuted 
                  and either executed or enslaved, as it is seen as an act against Amaunator himself.

                  hearing Amaunator's word and enforcing it. The people of the desert celebrate an annual Festival of the Sun that is held on the summer solstice on the 20th of Kythorn. 
                  The Festival of the Sun features food, music, and parades that worship Amaunator and his gift of the Sun and Time. Magic in the Crystal Desert is seen as a great gift 
                  bestowed upon the worthy by Amaunator, and is intensely studied and practiced in the city of Saifal. The children of the desert grow up working on local farms, in shops, taverns, 
                  and assisting craftsmen, with many aspiring to grow up crafting their own jewelry or brewing their own alcohols. Children that are blessed with the power of magic are often sent
